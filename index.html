    <h1>Snap Card Game</h1>
    <p>This is a basic simulation of the classic card game 'Snap'.</p>
    <h2>Intructions/Guide:</h2>
    <p>To start the game, press the "Start Game" button.<br>This will only work for 2 Players.<br>Once the game starts, the deck of cards will be split between the Players. Then, the game will automatically reveal the top card of each Player's Hand.<br>The game will then wait for a couple seconds, to allow for Players to claim a 'Snap' - if there is one.<br>A 'Snap' is when there is a matching number or letter on the two showing cards. <i>EXAMPLE: Player 1 has a 2 of Hearts, and Player 2 has a 2 of Clubs. This would be a Snap as both are showing the number 2.</i><br>The game ends when one Player has all the cards (and thus, wins). </p>
    <p>Player One's Snap Call button is "a"; whereas Player Two's Call button is "l".</p>
